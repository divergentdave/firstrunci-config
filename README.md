# firstrunci-config

`firstrunci` automates the testing of developer-facing installation instructions. This repository holds configuration files that define how each project is tested. See the [firstrunci](https://github.com/divergentdave/firstrunci) project for the tool that consumes these configuration files, as well as a description of the file format.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, both for updating configuration files to match upstream projects, and for adding new files for new projects. If you'd like to recommend a project to have a configuration file written, open an issue with your suggestion.
